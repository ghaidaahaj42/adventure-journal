# About Me  
## Ghaidaa Haj
I am a Computer Science and Business Administration student with many ambitions and goals set for the years ahead, I devote a great chunk of my time to volunteer and teach high school girls the basics of computer science to encourage them to pursuit their interests. I enjoy working with people and learning new things.
